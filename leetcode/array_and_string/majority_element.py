"""
Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2
 

Constraints:

n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 5 * 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
 

Follow-up: Could you solve the problem in linear time and in O(1) space?"""

    The given code is a Python implementation of the Boyer-Moore Majority Vote algorithm,
